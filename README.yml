    abstract: >
        Big data is great for real estate industry. Real estate is a
        massive industry, with over $235 billion per year in
        revenue. Analyzing real estate historical trends as it relates
        to housing bubble and predicting future outcome can become less
        of a complex process. Big Data analysis can also reveal the
        worth of neighboring properties which results in accurate
        estimates in shorter time spans. It offers some great insights
        on risk analysis and also helps to predict the worth of
        upcoming housing or building projects and helps determine
        realtors whether it is safe to invest or not.
